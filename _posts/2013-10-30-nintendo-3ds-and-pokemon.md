I've been playing Pokemon Y last few days. I bought a used 3DS and the retail game. 

I have a few things I'd like to speak out about going back to console gaming and using a nintendo console.

- **Nintendo makes awesome hardware.**  
  Even though this 3DS I bought is used and it appears has been treated like they wanted to kill it, it still plays and works without a problem.
- **They have a lot of attention to detail in their software.**  
  Most of the apps that come with the console and the UI they use, is really enjoyable. The sad thing is that even with that I don't have a lot of reasons to go back and play a lot of games or buy their other consoles.
- **The screens on the 3DS have low pixel count.**  
  I have to say that I feel spoiled by working with top of the line mobile phones. Having used the Samsung flagship phones and having my own android phone with basic 800x480 resolution, the 3DS screen feels so outdated that it hurts my HD-usedto-eyes.
- **Their IPs are still relevant.**  
  Pokemon made a huge impact on me when I was younger, and right now, playing this 6th gen version, it still feels like playing the first one. I don't have all the free time that I had back in the day, but playing this game still feels magical.

  In the end I still consider myself as a PC gamer and even with such games as Pokemon, I think nintendo is on the edge of loosing relevance to the general public. With mobile games and platforms constantly growing in margins, I think it's going to be more difficult for nintendo to stay relevant and continue showing us great products that people actually are willing to buy.
