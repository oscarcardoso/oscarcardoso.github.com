I've been working a couple of days a week in FTM since I'm getting more use to the whole living on my own thing. I haven't merged the source to the master branch since I'm still working on some of the forecasted features for this release.

The display of the total hours done in the previous days is done, so is the new algorithm to calculate a days hours. States have been also implemented and are being used to change the previous days state. 

A friend of mine is helping me finding bugs, he hasn't had the chance to use the Github tools to track the bugs, but since I see him often, I'm working on debugging most of the time. 

One of the next features I'm going to work on, for v005, is to have a "edit mode" so you can change time, date and delete events in one screen and that way it's going to be easier to update the changes in the view, otherwise is going to be a pain to handle or even to edit each event, one by one.

Maybe I'll have a full release of v004 by the end of November. Valve time.
