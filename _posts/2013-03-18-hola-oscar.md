### This is my first post for my userpage in github

I'm giving jekyll with bootstrap a try, although the instalation is easy, it proved to be a hazzle since I haven't used ruby, jekyll or bootstrap before. With a couple of minutes and careful research, I've been able to get it up and working.

This is the first time I sit down and write something about what I do and what are the projects I'm currently working on. It's really interesting to do it and to learn from this experience. Lately I've been thinking a lot about what will I do next and never start actually doing something, so I'm hoping this site will keep me moving with my projects.

Let's talk about them:

1. [FlexTimeMonitor](https://github.com/oscarcardoso/flextimemonitor "FlexTimeMonitor")
	
	This is my first android project from scratch, (at least, the only one that I can talk about). I've chosen to do this app just for the sake of fun and because at the end of the month, it gets kinda annoying to wait for HR office to publish the reviewed times. I've just made a really basic interface so far, but I'm looking to update it thru april. 

2. [oscarcardoso@github.com](http://oscarcardoso.github.com "oscarcardoso@github.com")
	
	I know, it's kind of lame to mention the actual github page as a project, but hey, it's one that will require time and effort to mantain updated! Not mentioning the problems that took me put it up online, I'm sure it'll be something to follow up. 

3. [Mexicali y sus alrededores](https://plus.google.com/photos/111011256838485291859/albums/5809076973738097345 "Mexicali y sus alrededores")

	Now, aside from all the coding and ranting about the world, I'm trying to take some pictures of my city from time to time. This is just for personal reasons and to stay off the programming side, you know, let it cool off.

That'll be it for this time.

See you soon!
