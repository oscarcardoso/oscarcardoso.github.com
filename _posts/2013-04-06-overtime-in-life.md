I stayed up late today just to make [FlexTimeMonitor](https://github.com/oscarcardoso/flextimemonitor/commit/ec62d8e4808ad87e999ddebd600b5abe5793c03c "FlexTimeMonitor") build in ant. 

I've set it up now and it's great to be able to avoid using Eclipse with my laptop, since it doesn't have too much RAM.

The bad thing is that it's already 3am and I've got a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.

Have a nice day guys!
